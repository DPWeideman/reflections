What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git folder is added which turns the folder into a repository. It is now possible for git to track your commits and other metadata

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary between the working directory and the repository. This is where you decide what you want to add to a commit before you make the commit. So it gives you a change to evaluate the validity of your commit before making it.
