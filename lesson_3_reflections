When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

The best use for a remote repository is probably when you want to collaborate with other people. You can also in a sense collaborate
with youself if you are using different computers to work on the same thing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Due to the fact that the changes might not have been made by you, and you might be working on something diffeerent, so you don't want to have the commits addes automatically to your branch whilst working on it. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a clone on Github, but with attribution. Clones are on your local machine or between your machine and Github. A branch exists within your repository. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work offline and then merge with the repository on github later. Also, you can solve merge conflicts that might arrise due to collaboration before merging.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

One would probably have to email each other. Would be a lot harder to do, since you wouldn't have verison control etc.
